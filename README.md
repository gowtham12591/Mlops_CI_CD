MLOPS - CI/CD Pipeline

Steps Involved to perform CI using github actions
1. Create a project and push it to github-repository
2. Click on add files and then create a new file name as '.github/workflows/cml.yaml
3. Here cml refers to continuous machine learning and it is an extension to perform CI/CD for machine learning applications
4. cml file can be either committed to master branch or we can create a seperate branch for our CI process.
5. Once the cml file is created, with some basic push to the repo or with any commits to the repo, continuous integration automatically happens with Actions.
6. You can find the status in the Actions tab
